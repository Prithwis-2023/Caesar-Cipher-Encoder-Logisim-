# Final Project Proposal: Caesar Cipher Encoder
Encryption has been at the core of secure communication since medieval times, driven by the need to protect sensitive information—especially in military contexts—from interception and interpretation by adversaries. My project, the Caesar Cipher Encoder, is a minimalistic yet functional recreation of one of the earliest known encryption techniques.

Devised by Julius Caesar, this cipher secures messages by shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on, wrapping around such that Z becomes A. Thus, the word **HELLO** would be encrypted as **IFMMP**. The recipient, knowing the shift value, can decrypt the message by shifting in the opposite direction.

This project presents a digital implementation of the Caesar cipher, simulated using Logisim, showcasing how classical encryption concepts can be realized using fundamental logic circuits.
